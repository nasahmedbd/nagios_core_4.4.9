# NSClient++

NSClient++ (nscp) is an open-source monitoring agent. It is designed to work with Nagios and compatible monitoring systems, but it can also be used as a standalone monitoring tool. NSClient++ provides various monitoring checks, including performance metrics, event log monitoring, service monitoring, process monitoring, and more.
NSClient++ is written in C++ and is available under the GNU General Public License. It is compatible with all versions of Windows and linux operating systems. NSClient++ can be installed as a service or as a standalone application, and it includes a command-line interface for managing configuration and monitoring tasks.

NSClient++ also supports various authentication methods, including Windows authentication, SSL/TLS certificates, and pre-shared keys. It also supports encryption and compression of communication between the monitoring system and the NSClient++ agent, providing secure and efficient communication.
Overall, NSClient++ is a reliable and flexible monitoring agent for Windows and linux systems, and it is widely used in the IT industry for monitoring the infrastructure.

How NSClient++ works-

It does basically three things:
1. Allow remote checks Allow a remote machine (monitoring server) to request commands to be run on this machine (the monitored machine) which returns the status of the machine.
2. Monitor system in real-time Monitor your systems and submit the findings and results to a remote (monitoring server).
3. Resolve your problems NSClient++ can take action either on its own monitoring or remotely from a central server and act on what happens and resolve issues.
